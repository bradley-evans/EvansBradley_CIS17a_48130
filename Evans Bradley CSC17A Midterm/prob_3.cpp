/**
Write a function using the following structure and prototype.

struct statsResult
{
    float avg;
    float median;
    int *mode;   //array containing the modes
    int nModes;  //number of modes in the array
    int maxFreq; //max frequency of modes
};

statsResult *avgMedMode(int *,int); 

The function takes in an integer array and the size of the array.
Then returns a pointer to a structure containing the average, median
and mode.  You will then write a printStat() function that will print
the results contained in the stats structure.  I will input a small 
array to test this out so ask for how many inputs to fill the array, 
then the values to place into the array.  Make sure you delete the 
dynamic array creation for the mode when you exit the problem.
